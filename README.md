# The Smurfs

We hate the typical "Google Questions" on our solicitation interviews. Fork and send us your code instead to show off your skills! (preferably privately! no fun in spoiling the solution for others)

## If you're the ideal candidate for this job, then you will find this assignment to be no burden at all.

This repository contains 9 images of the Smurfs. 
The assignment is simple: Write a program _**yourself**_ , using C# , that can automatically locate Papa Smurf and visually mark him on the picture.

**External libraries are not allowed!!** It is perfectly possible to get this done using only the .NET framework.

Googling is _allowed,_ as well as copy-pasting small snippets of existing code. 
We **do** expect you to understand all pieces of code you 'borrowed' and explain parts of them if needed.

Bonus points are awarded if you can design the program in such a way that it doesn't use a lot of CPU or RAM, but still manages to be blazing fast.

_**Happy coding!**_
